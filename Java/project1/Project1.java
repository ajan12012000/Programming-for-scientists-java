 * PROJECT I: Project1.java
 *
 * As in project 0, this file - and the others you downloaded - form a
 * template which should be modified to be fully functional.
 *
 * This file is the *last* file you should implement, as it depends on both
 * Point and Circle. Thus your tasks are to:
 *
 * 1) Make sure you have carefully read the project formulation. It contains
 *    the descriptions of all of the functions and variables below.
 * 2) Write the class Point.
 * 3) Write the class Circle
 * 4) Write this class, Project1. The Results() method will perform the tasks
 *    laid out in the project formulation.
